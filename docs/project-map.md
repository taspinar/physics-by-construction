| `scripts/verify.sh` | Runs the checks in `scripts/verify.conf`; used by humans, agents, and CI |
| `scripts/start-planning.sh` | Project Grill, requirements approval, and project planning in a planning worktree |
| `scripts/review-planning.sh` | Independent, read-only review of the planning documents |
| `scripts/revise-planning.sh` | The planner's decision per planning finding, then the revision |
| `scripts/finish-planning.sh` | Checks and records your approval of the planning; `--check` tests it |

| `scripts/start-feature.sh` | Creates the feature worktree and starts the implementer |
| `scripts/review-feature.sh` | Independent, read-only review of the complete feature diff |
| `scripts/triage-review.sh` | Classifies review findings, creates follow-up Issues, and publishes the reports on the Issue |
| `scripts/apply-triage.sh` | Lets an implementer resolve only the `FIX_NOW` findings |
| `scripts/finish-feature.sh` | Checks the feature and creates the commit |
| `scripts/check-review.sh` | Reports whether a review still matches what it covers |
| `scripts/update-issue-with-plan.sh` | Links an optional feature plan to its Issue |
| `scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh` | Removes a merged worktree and its branch and updates `main` |

## Script libraries

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|

| `scripts/lib/review-run.sh` | Running a read-only agent with one retry, and storing a review |
| `scripts/lib/fingerprint.sh` | Content fingerprints of a working tree or a set of files |
| `scripts/lib/scope.sh` | File-scope enforcement for write sessions |
| `scripts/lib/planning.sh` | The planning scope and the planning approval check |

## Agent contracts and schemas
