# Development

## One-time setup

A supported machine runs macOS or Linux. The setup below runs once per
machine and is the only step that may need administrator rights. Everything
after it, including `./scripts/verify.sh`, runs as a normal user and installs
no system packages.

1. Install the tools:

   | Tool | Purpose | macOS | Linux |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Git | Source control | Xcode command line tools, or `brew install git` | System package manager |
   | [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) | Python, the Python packages, and Quarto, all pinned in `uv.lock` | `brew install uv` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
   | [elan](https://lean-lang.org/install/manual/) | The Lean toolchain pinned in `lean/lean-toolchain` | `brew install elan-init`, or the command for Linux | `curl -sSf https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh \| sh` |
   | jq 1.6 or later | Used by the workflow self-tests | `brew install jq` | `sudo apt-get install jq` |

   Make sure `~/.elan/bin` is on your `PATH` afterwards; the elan installer
   offers to add it.

2. Install the locked Python environment and the browser build that the
   built-site checks use. The browser build is fixed by the Playwright
   version in `uv.lock` and is downloaded into your user cache.

   ```bash
   uv sync --locked
   uv run --locked playwright install --only-shell chromium
   ```

   On Linux the browser also needs system libraries. Add `--with-deps` to the
   second command to let Playwright install them on the distributions it
   supports (it asks for administrator rights):

   ```bash
   uv run --locked playwright install --with-deps --only-shell chromium
   ```

   On other distributions install the libraries by hand; the preflight check
   reports a browser that cannot start.

3. Check the result:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/doctor.sh
   ```

   It reports each prerequisite as `OK`, `WARNING`, or `FAILED` with a fix
   hint, exits non-zero when a required prerequisite is missing, and never
   modifies anything. Besides the tools above it checks what the agentic
   development workflow needs and verification does not: the GitHub CLI
   (`gh`), installed and authenticated, and the Codex or Claude CLI. A
   missing agent CLI fails when `.agents/agents.conf` assigns it to a role
   and is a warning otherwise. It also warns when a pull request into `main`
   can be merged while its checks fail, because no ruleset requires the
   `verify` status check; see `docs/deployment.md`.

The first verification run downloads the Lean toolchain and the Mathlib build
cache: about 0.5 GB of downloads that unpack to roughly 8 GB in `lean/.lake/`
and 3 GB in `~/.elan/`. Later runs reuse them. CI prepares its runner with the
same steps.

## Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

This one command reproduces the whole site and every lesson output. CI runs it
on every pull request as `./scripts/verify.sh --all`, which also runs the
workflow self-tests described below. It leaves the built site in `site/_site/`,
which Git ignores. Open `site/_site/index.html` in a browser to read it.

The checks are declared in `scripts/verify.conf`, and the workflow self-tests
in `scripts/verify-workflow.conf`. They run in this order:

| Check | What it does |
|---|---|
| `preflight` | Reports every missing prerequisite of the one-time setup with a fix hint, and confirms that the pinned browser build starts. |
| `preflight-test` | `tests/preflight-test.sh`: the preflight reports each missing prerequisite and is the first check. |
| `lint`, `format` | Ruff on the Python sources. |
| `unit-tests` | pytest on `tests/unit`: the behaviour of `src/pbc`. |
| `lean-build` | `scripts/check-lean.sh`: takes Mathlib from its build cache and never compiles it from source, builds every module under `lean/PhysicsByConstruction/`, then audits every declaration. A declared `axiom`, a `sorry`, or any axiom besides Lean's three standard ones fails the check. |
| `check-tests` | pytest on `tests/integration`: every check fails on an input that violates it, a lesson made from the template passes, and the CI workflow keeps its permission boundaries. |
| `lesson-checks` | pytest on `tests/lessons`: the lesson sources follow the format of `docs/authoring.md`. Front matter follows the schema, the required sections and the generated header are present, the lessons form one learning path (unique ids, orders without gaps or duplicates, prerequisites that exist, come earlier, and form no cycle), displayed code is an executed cell or marked "not verified", figure cells have alternative text, and no generated artifact is committed under `site/` or `src/`. |
| `site-build` | `scripts/build-site.sh`: Quarto executes every page in the locked environment and renders `site/_site/`. A failing cell or an equation that cannot become MathML fails the build. |
| `site-checks` | pytest on `tests/e2e`, on the built site served under its sub-path: nothing is loaded from another origin, no cookie is set, images have alt text and dimensions, internal links resolve, pages are readable without JavaScript and a script adds no content to them (except inside an element with `data-enhancement`, an `id`, and static content of its own), do not scroll sideways at phone, tablet, or desktop width and keep every image on the screen, and the axe-core scan finds no WCAG 2.1 A or AA violation. For lessons: every lesson has a built page with the required sections, the home page leads to every lesson without JavaScript, the learning path page and every lesson header show what the front matter says (order, difficulty, prerequisites, previous and next), excerpts are identical to their source in `src/pbc`, "not verified" material shows its label, and the commands of each "Reproduce this" section regenerate the published page and its figures within 30 seconds. |
| `determinism` | `scripts/check-determinism.sh`: builds a fresh copy of the site sources a second time and requires byte-identical output. |
| Workflow self-tests | The shell tests of the agentic development workflow in `tests/*-test.sh`. Run in CI always, and locally only when a workflow file changed; see "Workflow self-tests" below. |

Run one check on its own with the command from `scripts/verify.conf`, for
example `uv run --locked pytest tests/unit`. `site-checks` and `determinism`
need the output of `site-build`.

While writing, preview the site with live reload:

```bash
uv run --locked quarto preview site
```

How to write a lesson is described in `docs/authoring.md`; the template is
`docs/lesson-template.qmd`.

### Other browser engines

Verification uses Chromium. To run the built-site checks in Firefox or WebKit
as well, install those engines once and name the engine:

```bash
uv run --locked playwright install firefox webkit
uv run --locked pytest tests/e2e --engine firefox
uv run --locked pytest tests/e2e --engine webkit
```

### Updating the pinned toolchains

Every update is an ordinary pull request that has to pass verification.

- **Python packages, Quarto, Playwright, and GitHub Actions**: Dependabot
  proposes updates. By hand: `uv lock --upgrade`. A new Playwright version
  pins a new browser build; install it with the command of the one-time
  setup.
- **Lean and Mathlib** are bumped together by hand: set the Mathlib tag in
  `lean/lakefile.toml`, run `lake update` in `lean/` (it also updates
  `lean/lean-toolchain` and `lean/lake-manifest.json`), and commit all three
  files.
- **elan in CI** is pinned by version and checksum in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **The math font** is vendored; see `site/assets/fonts/README.md`.

## Configuring verification

`./scripts/verify.sh` runs the checks declared in `scripts/verify.conf`, one
per line:

```text
<name>: <command>
```

Every listed check is required. Each command runs with `bash -eo pipefail`
from the repository root, so a failing step in a pipeline or command sequence
fails the check. Its first word is the required tool. Verification fails
when that tool is missing or not executable, when a command exits non-zero, or
when the configuration is missing, empty, or malformed. All checks run even
after a failure, and a summary lists each check as `PASS` or `FAIL`.

There is no automatic stack detection and no optional check: remove a check
from `scripts/verify.conf` rather than letting it be skipped. CI declares no
check of its own; a check that is in neither `scripts/verify.conf` nor
`scripts/verify-workflow.conf` does not exist.

### Recorded verification

A run in which every check passed is recorded in `.agents/verification/passed`,
a working file that Git ignores, together with the fingerprint of the content
it verified. Any change to a file that Git does not ignore makes the record
stale, and a failing run removes it.

`./scripts/verify.sh --reuse` skips the run when the record matches the current
content exactly, and says so. `review-feature.sh` and `finish-feature.sh` call
it that way, so in a feature the checks run once per version of the content
instead of once per step: after fixes, `apply-triage.sh` verifies, and the
review and the commit that follow reuse that pass. Plain `./scripts/verify.sh`
always runs every check.

Two limits:

- The fingerprint does not cover files that Git ignores. A check that depends
  on ignored state, such as an installed dependency or a build cache, is not
  run again when only that state changed. CI runs every check on a clean
  checkout.
- A record is never accepted on an agent's word. `start-feature.sh` and
  `apply-triage.sh` discard the record when their agent session ends, so a
  record always comes from a run that you or a script started.

A record made without the workflow self-tests does not stand in for a run that
needs them, such as `--reuse --all`.

### Workflow self-tests

The tests of the workflow scripts (`tests/*-test.sh`) are declared separately,
in `scripts/verify-workflow.conf` (ADR 005). They test the workflow, not the
site, the Python package, or the proofs, so a change can break them only by
touching a workflow file. That file names those files in its `paths:` entry,
as Git pathspecs. `scripts/` is guarded as a whole, except the files excluded
there because no self-test reads them: `scripts/verify.conf` and the
project's own check scripts. Adding a check to `scripts/verify.conf`
therefore does not start the self-tests. Exclude a new project script there
when no self-test reads it.

`./scripts/verify.sh` runs the self-tests only when one of those files differs
from the base branch (`origin/main`, or `main`), counting uncommitted and
untracked files, or when it cannot tell, for example outside a Git repository.
Otherwise the summary reports them as `SKIP`. `./scripts/verify.sh --all`
always runs them, and CI uses it, so every pull request runs the self-tests.

The self-tests start `jq`, `git`, and `bash` thousands of times. On an Apple
Silicon Mac an x86_64 `jq`, such as the one Anaconda installs, runs under
Rosetta and roughly doubles their duration; `file "$(command -v jq)"` shows
which one is first on your `PATH`.

## Configuring agents

`.agents/agents.conf` assigns a provider and model to each workflow role, one
per line:

```text
<role>: <provider> <model>
```

| Role | Used by |
|---|---|
| `project-grill`, `project-planner` | `start-planning.sh` |
| `planning-reviewer` | reserved for planning review |
| `implementer` | `start-feature.sh` |
| `reviewer` | `review-feature.sh` |
| `triage` | `triage-review.sh` |
| `triage-implementer` | `apply-triage.sh` |

Supported providers are `codex` and `claude`. Set each model to one your
account supports, and use a different provider for a reviewing role than for
the role whose work it reviews.

Every workflow script accepts `--agent <agent>` and `--model <model>` to
override the configuration for one run. Overriding the provider requires a
model as well. The model is always passed to the provider, for Claude as well
as Codex, and is never replaced: an unknown provider, missing CLI, missing
model, or malformed configuration fails before the script creates a branch,
worktree, or file, and a model the provider rejects fails the run.

Agents run with one of two permission profiles. The profile follows from the
role, not from the provider or model configured for it: a reviewing role is
always read-only, a writing role always gets `write`.

- `write`: an interactive session that may modify its worktree and use the
  network, for example to install dependencies and run builds. Anything beyond
  that needs your permission. Claude accepts edits automatically and asks you
  before it runs a shell command. Codex works without asking inside a
  workspace-write sandbox with network access and asks you when a command
  needs to leave that sandbox, for example to write outside the worktree;
  Codex has no setting that asks per command without a sandbox. Used for
  planning, implementation, and applying triage.
- `read-only`: a non-interactive session that cannot modify files and gets no
  MCP servers, apps, or other tools from the user's configuration. Codex runs
  in a read-only sandbox without the user's `config.toml`, with apps, browser
  use, computer use, and web search disabled. Claude runs restricted: without user, project, or MCP
  configuration, with only its Read, Glob, and Grep tools, and without asking
  for any further permission. The script stores the agent's result. Used for
  review and triage.

A profile that a provider cannot enforce is an error; an agent is never started
with broader permissions instead.

## Project bootstrap workflow

Run project bootstrap from a clean checkout after recording the initial project
idea and completing `docs/repository-setup.md`:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/start-planning.sh [name] [--description <file>] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

If you already have a project description, pass it with `--description`:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh --description ~/notes/project-idea.md
```

The file may be anywhere, including outside the repository. An uncommitted
description inside the repository is the one change the clean-checkout check
allows.
The script copies it to `docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` in the planning worktree
before the first session. Project Grill reads it first and asks only about
what it leaves unresolved. Neither planning phase may modify it, and it is
committed with the planning branch as the recorded input. A missing, empty, or
non-regular file fails before a branch or worktree is created.

Project Grill uses role `project-grill` and the planning session uses role
`project-planner`; `--agent` and `--model` override both. The optional name
defaults to `project-bootstrap`. A custom planning cycle such as:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh architecture-refresh
```

creates `planning/architecture-refresh` in a sibling worktree named
`../<repository>-planning-architecture-refresh`.

The script fetches `origin/main` and creates the planning branch from that
remote ref without switching or modifying the primary checkout. It refuses a
dirty checkout, unsafe name, missing agent or prompt, unavailable base,
duplicate branch, or existing target path.

Bootstrap has two separate interactive agent sessions:

1. Project Grill reads the project context, asks only questions that materially
   affect product or technical direction, and refines
   `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` in Draft state.
2. The script validates and displays the requirements. It records Approved
   status and a UTC timestamp only after explicit human confirmation.
3. A fresh project-planner session consumes the approved requirements and
   creates or updates `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and only
   necessary ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.

Declining requirements approval or an agent failure stops the workflow and
leaves the planning worktree intact. Inspect or revise it there; the script
never substitutes another model or removes user work automatically.

After successful planning, continue in the planning worktree with the planning
review, revision, and approval described below. `finish-planning.sh` prints
the exact commit and push commands.

### Planning review

Before committing the planning, let an independent agent review it from the
planning worktree:

```bash
./scripts/review-planning.sh
```

It uses role `planning-reviewer` with the `read-only` profile; configure a
different provider than for `project-planner`. The reviewed file set is the
planning documents: `docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` when present,
`docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and
the ADRs in `docs/decisions/`. The script supplies their contents and their
diff against `origin/main`. The requirements must be approved first.

Each round is stored as `.agents/reviews/planning-<name>-review-NN.json` with
a generated report, in the same format as feature reviews but without an Issue.
The review covers only the planning documents, so it becomes stale when one of
them is added, changed, or deleted, and stays current otherwise
(`./scripts/check-review.sh`). A planning review is not triaged; it is
revised.

### Planning revision

Let the original project planner handle the findings of a current planning
review:

```bash
./scripts/revise-planning.sh --review .agents/reviews/planning-project-bootstrap-review-01.json
```

It uses role `project-planner` in two phases:

1. **Decide.** Read-only, the planner returns one decision per finding with a
   rationale: `ADOPT`, `REJECT`, `DEFER` (belongs to a later feature), or
   `ESCALATE` (needs a human product decision or a change to the approved
   requirements). Critical and major findings may only be adopted or
   escalated. The decisions are validated like review results, shown to you,
   and recorded only after your approval, as
   `.agents/reviews/<review>-revision.json` with a generated report.
2. **Revise.** A write session resolves exactly the adopted findings. It may
   change only `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and direct Markdown
   ADRs. Any other change, including to the requirements, the description, or
   a review artifact, and any commit fails the run and keeps the worktree for
   inspection.

Escalated findings are listed with the next step: change the requirements
through Project Grill and approve them again, or decide that the finding does
not apply. When the write session fails, the approved decisions stay recorded;
while the review is still current, running the script again applies them
without deciding again.

After a revision the review is stale by design. Run `review-planning.sh` for
the next round, and repeat until the review passes.

### Planning approval

When the latest review round is resolved, approve the planning:

```bash
./scripts/finish-planning.sh
```

The script refuses when a required document is missing, the requirements are
not approved, there is no planning review, the latest review is stale, the
latest round has a critical or major finding, a finding of the latest round
has no revision decision, an adopted finding is not applied yet, or a finding
of the latest round is escalated. It shows every rejected, deferred, and
escalated finding of all rounds, also before a refusal. A finding escalated in
an earlier round is not resolved by a newer review alone: you confirm that it
was resolved, and the approval records that. The approval covers exactly the
reviewed planning; a document that changes while the script waits for your
answer is refused.

The approval is recorded in `docs/PLANNING_APPROVAL.md`, which is committed with
the planning: the time, the planning branch, the final review round, the
review rounds, the findings that were not adopted, and the fingerprint of the
planning documents. Use it for the planning PR description, because review
and revision files are not committed.

Any later change to a planning document invalidates the approval:

```bash
./scripts/finish-planning.sh --check
```

exits 0 when the approval still matches the documents and 1 when it is missing
or stale. `create-feature-issue.sh <feature-id>` refuses to create a feature
Issue from a roadmap without a current approval, so a roadmap change after the
planning PR needs a new review round and approval.

Open and merge a planning PR before creating Issues for actionable roadmap
features. The script never implements features, creates Issues, commits,
pushes, opens or merges a PR, or deploys.

## Creating a feature Issue from the roadmap

When a roadmap feature becomes active, create its Issue from its block in
`docs/roadmap.md`:

```bash
./scripts/create-feature-issue.sh F03
```

The script finds the heading that starts with the feature ID, such as
`### F03 — Sharing`, and uses everything up to the next heading of the same or
a higher level as the Issue body, unchanged. The heading becomes the title, so
the feature ID stays visible and review triage can use it for follow-up
provenance. The script shows the proposed Issue and creates it only after your
approval.

It refuses a feature ID that is missing, used for more than one heading, or
has an empty block, and it does not create a second Issue for a feature that
already has one, open or closed. When the block refers to another feature
whose Issue is still open, it warns before asking.

Create Issues one feature at a time, only for work that is about to start. An
Issue that is not a roadmap feature can still be created from a title and a
body file:

```bash
./scripts/create-feature-issue.sh "Issue title" path/to/body.md [label]
```

## Canonical feature workflow

Start with an actionable GitHub Issue. Create a detailed implementation plan
under `.agents/plans/` for non-trivial work when warranted.

From a clean primary checkout, create the feature worktree and start the
implementation agent:

```bash
./scripts/start-feature.sh 12 player-movement
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/start-feature.sh <issue> [slug] [base-branch] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The slug names the branch and the worktree. Without one, the script derives it
from the Issue title: the title without its feature ID, in lowercase, as at
most four words joined by hyphens. The script fetches the selected remote base,
creates `feature/<issue>-<slug>` in a sibling worktree, and starts the agent
of role `implementer` inside that worktree. Untracked files in the checkout do
not matter; modified tracked files do, because they would not be part of the
new worktree. After the session it prints the worktree path and the next
commands.

A new worktree has none of the ignored files of the primary checkout.
`start-feature.sh` therefore runs `scripts/worktree-setup.sh` in the new
worktree before the agent starts, with the path of the primary checkout as its
argument. It copies `lean/.lake/`, Lean's packages and the unpacked Mathlib
build cache of about 8 GB, from the primary checkout, so the worktree does not
fetch and unpack them again. On macOS the copy shares its disk space with the
original. Run verification once in the primary checkout to have something to
copy. The script only saves time: when it fails, `start-feature.sh` reports
that and starts the agent anyway.

After the implementation agent exits, enter the feature worktree. When
independent review is required by `.agents/policies/autonomy.md`, run it before
committing so the reviewer includes the complete working-tree changes:

```bash
cd ../project-12-player-movement
./scripts/review-feature.sh 12
```

A reviewer cannot run the checks, so the review starts only when
`./scripts/verify.sh` passes for the content under review. The script runs it
first, names the failing check when it fails, and starts no agent then. The
review records that verification passed for the reviewed tree. To have a
failure reviewed, for example when its cause is unclear, pass
`--unverified "<reason>"`; the review then records the reason instead.

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/review-feature.sh <issue> [base-branch] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>] [--unverified "<reason>"]
```

It uses role `reviewer` with the `read-only` profile. The review is
non-interactive: the reviewer cannot modify files and has no network access, so
the script supplies the GitHub Issue and the complete diff against the base
branch, including uncommitted and untracked changes. The reviewer returns its
result as JSON and the script validates and stores it. An invalid result is
retried once and then rejected, and a reviewer that changed the working tree or
created a commit is reported as an error; in both cases no review is stored.

The review script must run from the matching feature worktree and needs an
authenticated GitHub CLI. Each round writes a numbered pair of files without
overwriting earlier reviews:

```text
.agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
.agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.md
```

See "Review and triage data" below for the two files.

Triage an explicit review artifact with an agent independent from the
implementation:

```bash
./scripts/triage-review.sh \
  .agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/triage-review.sh <review-json> [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The triage agent (role `triage`) classifies every finding as:

- `FIX_NOW`: resolve before the feature proceeds. Critical and Major findings
  always use this category.
- `DEFER`: valid non-blocking work proposed as a separate follow-up Issue.
- `ACCEPT`: consciously take no action, with an explicit rationale.

The script validates the decisions before showing them: every finding is
decided exactly once, Critical and Major findings are `FIX_NOW`, and a deferred
finding has a follow-up title, action, and acceptance criteria. Invalid
decisions are retried once and then rejected. A review without findings needs
no triage agent.

The script displays the complete proposal before side effects. Only after
interactive approval does it create one GitHub Issue per `DEFER` finding and
write a persistent, uniquely named artifact such as:

```text
.agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.json
.agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.md
```

That artifact maps the source review findings to their decisions and any
created Issue numbers. After storing it, the script publishes the review and
triage reports as one comment on the source Issue, so the outcome is visible in
the Issue and, through `Closes #12`, from the pull request. The reports are
rendered from the JSON. When they exceed the size of one GitHub comment, they
are published in numbered parts rather than shortened. A failed publication
keeps the stored triage and prints the command to retry each unpublished
part. Declining the proposal creates neither an artifact nor
Issues. The source review remains unchanged. The artifact is stored only after
every follow-up Issue exists; if creating one fails, nothing is stored and a
new triage reuses the Issues created so far, which it finds by their trace
token. A re-run reuses a follow-up Issue that already exists for a finding.

Deferred follow-up Issue titles include deterministic provenance:

```text
[F02][R01][S2] Concise follow-up title
```

The script obtains the feature ID from the source Issue title and the review
round and finding ID from the review. When no feature ID is available, it falls
back to the source Issue number:

```text
[#12][R01][S2] Concise follow-up title
```

Apply the approved `FIX_NOW` set from the same feature worktree:

```bash
./scripts/apply-triage.sh \
  .agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.json
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/apply-triage.sh <triage-json> [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The helper uses role `triage-implementer`. It validates the approved artifact and source review, shows the exact
`FIX_NOW` scope, and asks for confirmation before starting a write-capable
agent. It never passes `DEFER` or `ACCEPT` findings to that agent. After the
agent exits, it verifies that the review and triage artifacts are unchanged and
runs `./scripts/verify.sh`.

The helper does not commit, push, merge, deploy, or create/close Issues. Inspect
the resulting diff and run another independent review and triage when fixes
require confirmation.

### Review and triage data

Results that an agent writes and a script consumes are JSON. Each review and
each triage is stored as two files with the same name:

- `.json` is the source of truth. The scripts read only this file.
- `.md` is a report generated from the JSON for reading. It is never parsed;
  editing it has no effect.

Both are working files for the scripts during a feature and are ignored by
Git, so `git add .` does not commit them. The record that stays is the comment
on the Issue and the follow-up Issues, each of which names its source finding.

The agent's result must match a schema in `.agents/schemas/`
(`review.schema.json`, `triage.schema.json`). The schema is passed to the
provider CLI and the script checks the result again with `jq`, including rules
a schema cannot express. For a review, the verdict must follow from the
findings: `PASS` without findings, `PASS_WITH_MINOR_FINDINGS` with only minor
or suggestion findings, and `CHANGES_REQUIRED` with at least one critical or
major finding. What a reviewer could not verify belongs in `limitations` and
does not change the verdict.

The script, not the agent, numbers the findings: `C1` (critical), `M1` (major),
`MIN1` (minor), and `S1` (suggestion). Triage decisions and follow-up Issues
refer to those identifiers. When a result is invalid, the agent is asked once
more, with the reasons for the rejection.

Stored artifacts are checked with the same rules as agent results, plus the
fields the scripts own, so editing a stored artifact cannot weaken a decision.

Documents that people maintain, such as the roadmap, requirements, and
architecture, keep Markdown as their source.

### When a review becomes stale

Every review records a fingerprint of what it reviewed (`reviewed_tree`): the
Git tree hash of the file contents at review time, including uncommitted and
untracked changes. Review and triage artifacts and ignored files are not part
of it, except files Git already tracks. A review may instead cover an explicit
list of files (`reviewed_paths`); then only those files count.

The fingerprint depends on content, not on commits. Committing the reviewed
content keeps the review current; changing, adding, or deleting a covered file
makes it stale. `triage-review.sh` and `apply-triage.sh` refuse a stale review
before they start an agent. After `apply-triage.sh` changes the code, the
review is stale by design: run a new review when the fixes need confirmation.

Check a review yourself with:

```bash
./scripts/check-review.sh .agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
```

It exits 0 when the review is current, 1 when it is stale, and 2 on an error.
Every script that refuses a stale review, and `check-review.sh`, first lists
the files that changed since the review, as added, modified, or deleted.

### Finishing a feature

When the latest review round is resolved, finish the feature from its
worktree:

```bash
./scripts/finish-feature.sh 12 "Implement player movement"
```

The script refuses another branch than `feature/12-*` or a tree without
changes, runs `./scripts/verify.sh`, and checks the latest review of the
feature: it must be current and have no critical or major finding. Every
review round with findings needs an approved triage that was published on the
Issue (the newest triage of that round counts), and the latest round may have
no `FIX_NOW` findings left to apply. After fixes, run a new review round first;
a passed newer round confirms the fixes of earlier rounds. A failed
publication can be repeated with `./scripts/triage-review.sh --publish
<triage-json>`.

It then stages all changes (review and triage files are ignored) and opens a
structured commit message in your editor: the summary, the Issue, a list of
changes to fill in, the verification, the review round and verdict, and
`Refs #12`. Emptying the message aborts the commit and leaves the changes
staged. The script never pushes, opens a PR, or merges.

A change that `.agents/policies/autonomy.md` classifies as low risk may be
finished without an independent review; the reason is recorded in the commit
message:

```bash
./scripts/finish-feature.sh 12 "Fix a typo in the README" --no-review "documentation only"
```

When the feature needs a step that only you can do, such as a repository
setting or a secret, the implementer records it in
`.agents/manual-steps/<issue>.md`. `finish-feature.sh` shows those steps before
the commit and records them in the commit message under `Manual steps:`; the
file itself is a working file and is not committed.

Then publish the feature:

```bash
./scripts/publish-feature.sh 12
```

The script pushes the branch, opens a pull request whose description is the
commit message, the manual steps, and `Closes #12`, and waits for its checks.
For a pull request that is already open it pushes and replaces the
description with the current one, since a fix round can change the manual
steps. It never merges. It ends with the result:

- all checks passed: the pull request is ready for you to merge;
- a check failed: it exits non-zero and tells you not to merge. Fix the cause
  in the worktree, then review, finish, and publish again;
- no checks were reported: the repository has no CI for pull requests, and the
  script says that nothing verified the change on GitHub.

`--no-wait` stops after the pull request is open. Local verification during a
feature never runs on a clean checkout, and may run on another operating
system than CI, so a failure can appear in CI only; wait for it before
merging. A ruleset that requires the CI status check on `main` makes GitHub
refuse a merge while a check fails; `./scripts/doctor.sh` warns when `main`
has no such rule.

After the merge GitHub closes the linked Issue. From the primary checkout,
remove the merged worktree and its branch:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh 12
```

The script asks GitHub whether the branch's pull request is merged, so it also
works after a squash merge. It refuses an unmerged worktree, a branch with
commits after its merged pull request, and a worktree with uncommitted changes;
ignored review and triage files do not count. After removing the worktree and
the local branch it fast-forwards `main` when the primary checkout is on `main`
without modified tracked files; untracked files do not prevent that. After a
merged planning it also removes an untracked file in the primary checkout that
is identical to `docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md`, such as the original idea file. A planning worktree is cleaned with
`./scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh planning/<name>`, every merged worktree at once
with `--merged`, and an abandoned, unmerged one with `--discard` after
confirmation.

## Linking a feature plan

To add or update the plan reference in an existing Issue:

```bash
./scripts/update-issue-with-plan.sh 12 .agents/plans/12-player-movement.md
```

The helper manages one delimited plan block in the Issue body. Re-running it
updates that block instead of appending duplicates. It stores only the
repository-relative plan path; the detailed plan remains in `.agents/plans/`.

## Lifecycle

The complete lifecycle, with diagrams and a reference table per step, is in
`docs/workflow.md`.
